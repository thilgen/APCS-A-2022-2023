// FizzBuzz revisited, now with for loops!
//
// FizzBuzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
// Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible
// by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
// (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
//
// This is also a common programming interview question!
//
// Exercise:
// Write a program from scratch that prints out the first 100 strings in the
// FizzBuzz sequence.
// For each integer i from 1 to 100, print out a line:
// FizzBuzz if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
// Fizz     if i is divisible by 3.
// Buzz     if i is divisible by 5.
// i        if none of the above conditions are true
//
// You can compare your output with ForBuzz.txt to make sure you've
// done it correctly. You can consult your earlier FizzBuzz code too.
//

class ForBuzz {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // TODO Add your loop here.
  }
