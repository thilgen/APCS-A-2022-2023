Dear $NAME,

I wanted to take the opportunity to write you to offer my most
$ADJECTIVE1 and $ADJECTIVE2 thanks and gratitude for your
recent gift to me of a $GIFT on the occasion of my birthday.

Your boundless generosity never ceases to $VERB me.
I do hope that we will have the pleasure of spending time
together again soon.

From the depths of my heart,
$ME
