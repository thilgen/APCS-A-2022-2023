   * YOUR INSTRUCTIONS:
   * This is a functioning implementation of the Hasbro classic board game, Battleship.
   * You can consult the official rules for Battleship here:
   * https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf
   *
   * This is a one-player version of the game where the user plays against the computer.
   * However, the computer opponent is very simplistic... it just fires at random.
   * The game also doesn't let the player layout the ships exactly as they want them.
   * You'll be fixing this and making other enhancements.
   *
   * 1. The game exits after you win or lose. Change it so the game asks whether you'd like
   *    to play again. If the player says yes, the game should restart from a blank state.
   *    (If you're writing a lot of code to reset the game, consider other options...
   *     this should only take a few lines!) (10 points)
   * 2. Add a cheater "peek" command that lets you see the positions of your opponent's
   *    ships. The format is whatever you like; it does not have to be a grid. (10 points)
   * 3. Make it so pressing Return instead of entering a valid move makes a random move.
   *    (10 points)
   * 4. The player's ships are laid out randomly right now. Ask the user when the game
   *    starts whether they want random or manual layout. If they choose manual layout,
   *    ask them for the starting position and whether to lay out horizontal/vertical
   *    for each ship in the navy. Print an error and ask again if they choose an
   *    impossible position (goes off edge of grid or conflicts with another ship.)
   *    (30 points)
   * 5. Implement the "AI" for choosing the computer's next move by implementing the
   *    selectTarget() method of class Player. This does not have to be perfect, but it
   *    should do a better job than firing randomly. At a minimum, if the computer has
   *    scored a hit and the ship isn't sunk yet, the computer should fire on a
   *    not-yet-fired-upon location adjacent to such a hit. Full points will be given
   *    for that. See the two pseudocode examples at the bottom of these instructions.
   *    A sophisticated implementation will be able to see that a series of hits are
   *    horizontal or vertical, and know to fire upon the next adjacent horizontal or
   *    vertical space. (30 points)
   * 6. The AI for choosing the computer's move should be able to function as a hint mode
   *    for the player too. Add a "suggest" command which uses the AI to suggest a next
   *    move for the player. (10 points)
   *
   * Note: Your AI should NOT cheat... even though your code can access the location
   * of the player's ships, the AI should play like a player that can't see the
   * exact locations and has to figure out where the ship is by trial and error.
   *
   * BASIC COMPUTER OPPONENT ALGORITHM PSEUDOCODE:
   *
   * This is example pseudocode for a basic computer opponent AI. If you do just this
   * level of computer opponent and it works without bugs, you'll get full points for #5.
   *
   * 1. Search the entire grid representing your player's view of the opponent (opponentGrid)
   *    for a cell that has been fired upon, that is a hit, and where the ship has not
   *    yet been sunk.
   *    - When such a cell is found, look one cell in all directions, left/up/right/down,
   *      for a cell that has not yet been fired on. If found, return that as the location
   *      to fire on.
   *    - If no such adjacent cell is found, resume the loop of looking for cells
   *      with hits on ships that haven't been sunk yet.
   * 2. If no cells were found to fire on in step 1, fire randomly on a location that
   *    has not yet been fired on.
   *
   * SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER OPPONENT ALGORITHM PSEUDOCODE:
   *
   * Here's example pseudocode for a computer opponent AI. This is just one possible
   * approach; you can implement it this way or in a way of your choosing, as long as
   * it's more effective than purely random fire!
   *
   * We look for "lines" of adjacent cells in the opponentGrid where every cell in
   * the line meets this criteria:
   * - It's the same ship, that is, cell.getShip() returns the same value.
   * - The cell has registered a hit, that is, cell.isHit() returns true.
   * - The ship has not yet been sunk, that is, cell.getShip().isSunk() returns false.
   *
   * To each sides of such a line are either the end of the grid, or a cell that doesn't
   * match this criteria.
   *
   * Algorithm: Try each of these steps in turn.
   * 1. Search the grid for horizontal lines with length >= 2. When one is found:
   *    - If there is a not-fired-on cell to the line's left, return as location to fire on.
   *    - Or if there is a not-fired-on cell to the line's right, return as location to fire on.
   * 2. Search the grid for vertical lines with length >= 2. When one is found:
   *    - If there is a not-fired-on cell directly above the line, return as location to fire on.
   *    - Or if there is a not-fired-on directly under the line, return as location to fire on.
   * 3. Look for any cell that is a "hit" with a ship that not yet been sunk.
   *    - If found, find any adjacent cell left/up/right/down that has not yet been fired on,
   *      and return that cell as the location to fire on.
   * 4. If none of steps 1-3 found a cell to fire on, fire on a random location that has
   *    not yet been fired on.
